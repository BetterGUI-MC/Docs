# Message Color

## Basic Color

* Some options that accepts a string can also support colors in that string
* You can use colors to "colorize" the string. If you have been using other plugins that interact with messages and texts, you may be familiar with some color characters (`&c`, `&b`, etc) or a combination of color and transformation (`&c&l`, `&b&o&l`, etc).

* You can use `&u` to get the random color for the text

## HEX Color

* After the 5.0 update, BetterGUI now supports HEX color (the thing with 3 Red Green Blue values) in texts and messages.
* You can use it by using the HEX format `&#rrggbb` (`rr`, `gg` and `bb` are the value of the red, green and blue channel of the color, from `00` to `FF`)
* For example, `&#FF0000` represents the red color. `&#FF0000Hello World!` will return the red `Hello World!`
