# Variable

* Variable (or sometimes Placeholder) is a special string that will be replaced to a value that is relative to the player.
* Variables can be seen as the string inside curly brackets `{}`. We will see some of these variables in the next section.
* You can use [`/getvariables`](/basic/command) to get the list of registered variables
* You can use variables in your text by putting them in curly brackets. For example, `Hello {player}!` will say hello to the player, with `{player}` replaced to the player's name.

## Menu variables

* There are variables are generated by the menu.
  * You can use [`/getvariables <menu>`](/basic/command) to get the list of registered variables for the specific menu
* To use variables from another menu: `{menu_<menu_name>.yml_<variable>`
  * Example: If you use [Store Argument Processor](/argument/store) in a menu called `test.yml` and want to use `{merged_args}` in other menus, you can use `{menu_test.yml_merged_args}`

## [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)

* You can use placeholders from [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) in your text.
* You can also use variables from BetterGUI to other plugins via [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)
  * The format for this is `%bettergui_<variable>%` (`<variable>` is a variable without the curly brackets `{}`)
  * For example, this is the placeholder to use `{player}` in other plugins: `%bettergui_player%`
