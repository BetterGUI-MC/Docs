# Item Modifier

* Item Modifier is the property of an item. It describes what the final item should be.
* There are a lot of built-in modifiers for items (Check the sidebar). A developer can also make his own modifier and register to the plugin.

## Example
```yaml
stone-button:
  slot: 1
  id: stone
  name: "&cThis is a stone button"
  lore:
  - "This is just a stone button"
  - "&uNothing special"
```
