This is a dynamic button which displays the frame buttons one-by-one.

## Format

```yaml
button-name:
  type: animated
  update: <ticks>
  shift: <number>
  reverse: <true/false>
  child:
    button1:
      <button-settings>
    button2:
      <button-settings>
    button3:
      <button-settings>
    ...
```

## Note

* `child`: the list of [Button]({{% relref "../overview" %}}) that serves as the frames of the animattion.
* `update`: the ticks between two frames.
* `shift`: the index of the starting frame.
  * If you set a positive value (`n`), the `n`-th frame will be the start frame.
  * If you set a negative value (`-n`), the `n`-th frame from the bottom will be the start frame.
* `reverse`: whether to flip the frames, so that the frames will go bottom-up.
