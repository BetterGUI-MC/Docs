+++

This mask is similar to [Button Paginated Mask]({{% ref "../button-paginated" %}}), but you can filter out the buttons with specific requirements.

## Format

```yaml
mask-name:
  mask: filtered-button-paginated
  slot: <slot>
  cycle: <true/false>
  signal: <signal>
  update: 20
  child:
    button-1:
      <button-settings>
      filter-requirement:
        <requirement-set>
        <requirement-set>
        <requirement-set>
        ...

    button-2:
      <button-settings>
      filter-requirement:
        <requirement-set>
        <requirement-set>
        <requirement-set>
        ...

    button-3:
      <button-settings>
      filter-requirement:
        <requirement-set>
        <requirement-set>
        <requirement-set>
        ...
    ...
```

## Note

* `cycle`: Whether the buttons should cycle when you reach the end of the page. If this is set to `true`, then when you reach the end of the page, it will go back to the first page. If this is set to `false`, then when you reach the end of the page, it will stop at the last page.
* `signal`: The signal name used by actions to change the page.
* `update`: The ticks to wait before the mask is refreshed.
* You can use `filter-requirement` on the button to remove it from the list if the player doesn't meet the requirements.
  * It's similar to `view-requirement`, but the difference is that, while buttons with `view-requirement` will leave an empty button on the list, those with `filter-requirement` will be removed from the list if the player doesn't meet the requirements.

## Action

* `next-page: <signal>`: Changes the page to the next page.
* `previous-page: <signal>`: Changes the page to the previous page.
* `set-mask(<signal>): <page>`: Changes the page to `<page>`.
