It is a mask that shows the progress of the player. It is useful for showing the progress of the player in a quest or a game.

## Format

```yaml
mask-name:
  mask: progress
  slot: <slot>
  current: <current-value>
  max: <max-value>
  current-button:
    <button-settings>
  max-button:
    <button-settings>
```

## Note

* `current`: The current value of the progress. It can be a number or a placeholder.
* `max`: The max value of the progress. It can be a number or a placeholder.
* `current-button`: The [Button]({{% ref "button/overview" %}}) that represents the filled part of the progress.
* `max-button`: The [Button]({{% ref "button/overview" %}}) that represents the empty part of the progress.

## Example

```yaml
demo-slot:
  mask: progress
  current: "{level}"
  max: 45
  slot: 1-1-9-5
  current-button:
    id: green_stained_glass_pane
    name: "&a&lCurrent: &e{level}"
  max-button:
    id: red_stained_glass_pane
    name: "&c&lMax: &e45"
```

Don't worry about the weird last row. I'll explain it later.
