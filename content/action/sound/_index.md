This action will send the sound to the player.

## Format

* `sound: <sound>, [volume], [pitch]`
* `sound: <sound> [volume] [pitch]`
* `raw-sound: <sound>, [volume], [pitch]`
* `raw-sound: <sound> [volume] [pitch]`

## Note

* `<sound>` supports Minecraft's sound name, so it also supports custom sounds from Resource Pack. If the `<sound>` can not be found, the action is simply ignored.
* You can specify the `[volume]` and the `[pitch]` of the `<sound>`. Those are optional.

## Example

* `sound: BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_PLING`
* `sound: BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_PLING 1 2`
